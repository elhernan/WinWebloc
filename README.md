WinWebloc
=========

An extremely simple console application for windows (.Net 3.5 required) to open OS X's webloc files in your default browser.

I created this out of the need to work in a mixed platform environment, dropbox syncs my weblocs to windows and they won't open... WELL NOW THEY DO!!! :satisfied:
