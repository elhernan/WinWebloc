WinWebloc
=========

An extremely simple console application for windows (.Net 3.5 required) to open OS X's webloc files in your default browser.

I created this out of the need to work in a mixed platform environment, dropbox syncs my weblocs to windows and they won't open... WELL NOW THEY DO!!! :satisfied:

It is not an elegant solution, it's actually kind of brute force-ish, but it's fast and it works; which covers my requirements.

If you find a webloc that won't work, please paste it here in the issues so we can debug it.

And why did I do it in Vb.net? Why not?! :yum:
